# TechnicalAnalysis-FrontEnd

Welcome to the TechnicalAnalysis-FrontEnd repository! This project is part of my Bachelor's Thesis research and it is designed to provide a comprehensive front-end application for technical analysis of software projects. The application leverages quality analysis tools and libraries to help users control and manage software's technical debt.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kostasthomson/TechnicalAnalysis-FrontEnd.git
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd TechnicalAnalysis-FrontEnd
3. **Install the dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

## Usage

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
npm start
```
or
```bash
yarn start
```

This will start the application at http://localhost:3000.

To build the project for production, use:

```bash
npm run build
```
or
```bash
yarn run build
```

This will create an optimized build of the application in the build directory.
